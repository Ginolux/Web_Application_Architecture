<h2> Project: Online Movie Rental System </h2>

My project is a movie ranting application that aggregate all the movies in different stores in the city in one place.

In the application, users are be able to:

 <ul>
  <li>register, login, logout</li>
  <li>search for movies</li>
  <li>see movie availability</li>
  <li>see stores where the movie is availabe</li>
  <li>see the closest store to user location</li>

</ul> 

 Users can see different categories of movies available in the stores along with all the informations: title, year, description, language, rating.
 
<b>Underlying technology:</b>
I used Bootstrap for the front-end. 
For the back-end, I used PHP with MariaBD server.
